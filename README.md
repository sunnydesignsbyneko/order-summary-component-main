## My process
This was my first time using Flexbox, so I took a long time to figure it out. 

I first started by figuring out how to layout the components on paper.

I then moved on and put all the components I needed in HTML and began styling it in CSS. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Although flexbox is still something I am still learning, I learned how useful it can be when laying out components!

### Continued development

I plan on continuing to learn how to use flexbox to make the layouts of my pages cleaner! I also want to learn best practices when writing up HTML and CSS.
